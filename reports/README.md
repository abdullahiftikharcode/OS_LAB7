# Test Reports Directory

This directory contains all test reports generated by Valgrind and ThreadSanitizer.

## Files

### Valgrind Reports
- `valgrind_report.txt` - Memory leak detection report

### ThreadSanitizer Reports  
- `tsan_report.txt*` - Race condition detection reports (numbered by PID)

### Other Reports
- `*.log` - Various log files from test runs
- `*.txt` - Test output files

## Viewing Reports

### Valgrind Report
```bash
cat reports/valgrind_report.txt

# Look for:
# - LEAK SUMMARY
# - ERROR SUMMARY
```

### ThreadSanitizer Report
```bash
cat reports/tsan_report.txt*

# Look for:
# - "WARNING: ThreadSanitizer: data race"
# - "WARNING: ThreadSanitizer: lock-order-inversion"
```

## Understanding Results

### ✅ Good Valgrind Output
```
LEAK SUMMARY:
   definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
   indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
   possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
   still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks

ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts
```

### ✗ Bad Valgrind Output
```
LEAK SUMMARY:
   definitely lost: 1,024 bytes in 8 blocks  ← FIX THIS!
   indirectly lost: 512 bytes in 4 blocks    ← FIX THIS!
```

### ✅ Good TSAN Output
- No files generated, OR
- Files exist but contain no "WARNING" messages

### ✗ Bad TSAN Output
```
WARNING: ThreadSanitizer: data race (pid=1234)
  Write of size 4 at 0x7b0400001234 by thread T2:
    #0 some_function file.c:45
```

## Cleanup

To remove old reports:
```bash
rm -f reports/*.txt reports/*.log
```

## Notes

- Reports are automatically generated when you run test scripts
- Each TSAN run creates a new numbered file (e.g., `tsan_report.txt.1234`)
- Keep reports for documentation/debugging purposes
- Add `reports/` to `.gitignore` if you don't want to commit them
